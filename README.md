# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose of the Analysis
The purpose of our analysis was to take the earthquake data map we previously created with the locations and magnitudes of each earthquake, and build on it. We previously set our map up to display two styles for the user: street and satellite street mode. We added an additional dark map and two additional layers: a layer showing the earth's tectonic plates in relation to the earthquake data, and a layer displaying pindrops on those considered to be major earthquakes (magnitude of 4.5 or higher). This provides the user with a visually appealing display of our earthquake data.
